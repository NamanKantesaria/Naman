        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am Dr. Naman Kantesaria, a highly motivated and dedicated geotechnical engineer with a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering and over two years of research experience in soil mechanics and physical modelling. Currently, I am working as an Assistant Professor at the Institute of Technology, Nirma University, where I teach undergraduate and postgraduate courses, conduct research work, and perform various administrative tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            During my Ph.D., I investigated the small and large strain shear characteristics of compacted high plasticity clay subjected to static and dynamic loading. My research focused on understanding the effects of stress-induced anisotropy, stress history, and suction on strain energy, yielding, and undrained shear characteristics of compacted CH soil. Additionally, I evaluated the dependency of small strain shear modulus on stress states, studied the cyclic degradation and cyclic pore water pressure response of compacted CH soil, and analyzed the micro and macroscopic characteristics of biopolymer stabilized expansive soil.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a research fellow at the University of Nottingham, I performed geotechnical centrifuge testing of spoil models to understand the challenges of spoil material characterization and develop possible foundation and slope stability solutions to overcome them. I also conducted advanced elemental experiments to characterize the complex hydromechanical behaviour of heterogeneous spoil material.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moreover, during my post-doctoral fellowship at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, I worked on developing a constitutive model using the Disturbed State Concept (DSC) to characterize the undrained dynamic shear response of compacted high-plasticity clay.
        </p>
        <p>
            My research interests include experimental soil mechanics, soil dynamics, liquefaction and cyclic softening characteristics, physical modelling in geomechanics, coupled hydromechanical response of unsaturated soils, ground improvement using geosynthetics and bio-mediated methods, microstructure and macroscopic behaviour of clays, mechanical characterization of geomaterials, and engineering applications of waste/recycled materials.
        </p>
        <p>
            With my academic background and research experience, I am confident I can make valuable contributions to geotechnical engineering. I am always eager to learn and take up new challenges.
